# To-Do
* update text bubbles to not overlap

# Issues
* instead of pulling from API rn, create own library of words based on difficulty?
* sprite not cycling correctly

# Future Updates
## Blockades
* create blockades that can only be destroyed based on a minimum WPM
## Levels
* create levels of differing difficulty (length of words/quotes, punctuation)
* change background and music based on difficulty
* increase music speed based on difficulty
* change to darker/redder background based on difficulty
